## Introduction & Motivation

I want to share my experience building this website using `Next.js` - which is something I have wanted to do since my days in ExpressVPN in 2022. I Like most other personal projects, this one eventually got shelved so hard that I had completely forgotten about it. Alas! I finally got to it in 2025.
I've always had a soft spot for typing, writing, just letting my thoughts spill out (my friends do call me a yapper...). Honestly, I think I was at my most coherent back in JC, when GP forced us to write essay after essay. There's something about being made to structure your arguments and wrangle your ideas into words that just makes your brain work better. It's almost like therapy, but with more hand cramps and an enlarged "tumour" on my middle finger (**shoutout to all-time goated pilot G2 0.5**).
I also love the idea of having a one-stop shop for everything I've built, and everything about me (as narcissistic as that sounds). What better way to do that than to build my own website? Unfortunately, when I was knee-deep in learning data engineering back in 2022, there was just no way I could carve out the time or focus to start a site from scratch. It's not a speedrun-able side quest.

## So... was it difficult?

AI has honestly changed the game. Not so much because it spits out perfect code (spoiler: it doesn't), but because it's akin to having a super patient, super knowledgeable teacher on call 24/7. The real magic is how it helps you put structure to the things you don't even know you don't know. You start with a vague idea, and it helps you map out the unknowns, gives you a checklist, and suddenly learning a new framework doesn't feel like I'm wandering in the dark. It's really not about getting the answer — it's about getting a path forward. So there's always going to be a next step you can take.

## The "difficult"

Of course, it's still not easy. Bugs still pop up, errors still need to be debugged, and even with AI's structure, you have to put in the work to actually understand what's going on. Figuring out when to use `useRef` versus `useState`, or what all the other hooks do, is still on you.
The most memorable (and painful) lesson for me was trying to wrap my head around what happens when a supposedly full-size image gets shrunk from a massive monitor down to a tiny phone screen. Suddenly, you're dealing with containers, viewports, svg coordinates, scaling, offsets and what have you. It was a headache, but also kind of fun in a masochistic way.

## Reflection

I genuinely enjoyed this whole process (not that it's done though) because of how much I learned along the way. What started as a simple goal of building a personal website quickly turned into a crash course in frontend styling, SVG positioning, mobile responsiveness, build pipelines, deployment quirks, and the occasional existential CSS bug.
If anything, it’s proof that AI really does _sUpEeRcHaarRGeE_ learning. I didn’t follow a structured course or sit through hours of tutorials (I did watch 6 to 8 youtube videos though), but instead asked targeted questions when I got stuck, got just enough context to move forward, and learned by building.
I’m also not here to argue whether AI will replace engineers. That question feels increasingly beside the point. What I’m convinced of is that it has permanently changed how we learn, problem-solve, and build. Not by doing everything for us, but by giving us a kind of thinking partner — one that doesn't get tired, doesn't judge, and has read way more documentation than I ever will.
