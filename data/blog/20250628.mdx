## Introduction

As someone who loves automating repetitive tasks and experimenting with cloud-native architectures, I recently built two Telegram bots to solve real-world problems for my friends and myself:

- **Poll Dispatcher Bot:** Automates sending out Telegram polls on a schedule.
- **Bill Splitter Bot:** Makes splitting group expenses seamless and secure.

Both bots leverage serverless technologies, but each has a unique architecture and set of technical challenges. Here’s how I built them, why I made certain choices, and what I learned along the way.

## Poll Dispatcher Bot: EventBridge → Lambda → Telegram

<div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="/static/images/diagrams/shaka.png"
    alt="Shaka Diagram"
    className="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    style={{ width: '60%', minWidth: '250px', maxWidth: '600px' }}
  />
</div>

### **Motivation**

I wanted a way to automatically send out recurring polls to a Telegram group (e.g., "Who's joining the run this weekend?") without manual intervention. The solution needed to be reliable, easy to update, and most importantly FOC.

### **Architecture**

<div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="/static/images/diagrams/shaka-archi.png"
    alt="Shaka Architecture Diagram"
    className="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    style={{ width: '30%', minWidth: '250px', maxWidth: '600px' }}
  />
</div>

1. **AWS EventBridge**
   - Acts as a scheduler (cron) to trigger events at specific times (e.g., every Friday at 6pm).
2. **AWS Lambda**
   - Receives the EventBridge event, constructs the poll, and sends it to the Telegram Bot API.
3. **Telegram Bot**
   - Receives the poll and posts it in the group chat.

**Why this setup?**

- **EventBridge** is a native, serverless scheduler—no need for EC2 or external cron jobs.
- **Lambda** is perfect for lightweight, event-driven tasks and scales to zero.
- **No persistent infrastructure** - I only pay for what I use.

### **Key Technical Details**

- **Error Handling:**  
  Lambda retries on failure, and errors are logged to CloudWatch for easy debugging.
- **Extensibility:**  
  Adding new poll types or schedules is as simple as updating the EventBridge rule or Lambda code.
- **CICD:**
  Any changes to lambda code will be automatically deployed as part of GitHub Actions Workflow to S3, followed by a `terraform apply` to update Lambda Function.

## Bill Splitter Bot: Telegram → Cloudflare Worker → AWS API Gateway → Lambda

<div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="/static/images/diagrams/lilith.gif"
    alt="Lilith Diagram"
    className="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    style={{ width: '40%', minWidth: '250px', maxWidth: '600px' }}
  />
</div>

### **Motivation**

Splitting bills in group chats can get messy. I wanted a bot that could help with common real-life scenarios, such as:

- When different people pay for different shared items (e.g. at hawker centres like Chomp Chomp, Newton, or Bedok 85), and you want to settle up easily at the end.
- When one person pays for the entire meal, but everyone orders different items — some shared, some not — and you need to fairly calculate how much each person owes the payer.

### **Architecture**

<div className="my-8 flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="/static/images/diagrams/lilith-archi.png"
    alt="Lilith Architecture Diagram"
    className="h-auto max-w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    style={{ width: '70%', minWidth: '250px', maxWidth: '600px' }}
  />
</div>

1. **Telegram Bot**
   - Users interact with the bot via commands.
2. **Webhook to Cloudflare Worker**
   - Telegram sends updates to a Cloudflare Worker endpoint.
3. **Cloudflare Worker (Reverse Proxy & Verifier)**
   - Verifies the Telegram secret token.
   - Forwards valid requests to a REST API endpoint (AWS API Gateway).
4. **AWS API Gateway (with Resource Policy)**
   - Only allows requests from Cloudflare IPs (extra security).
5. **AWS Lambda**
   - Processes the bill splitting logic and formats the reply.
6. **Telegram Bot**
   - Sends the reply back to the user/group.

### **Key Technical Details**

- **Security:**
  - The Cloudflare Worker acts as a reverse proxy, verifying the Telegram secret token before forwarding.
  - AWS API Gateway resource policy only allows whitelisted Cloudflare IPs, blocking direct access.
- **Serverless & Cost-Effective:**
  - Cloudflare Workers and Lambda both scale to zero and have generous free tiers.

## **Why This Architecture?**

AWS has very generous limits before usage is billable - which is why you will realise most of the tools/services I have decided to use are from AWS.

- **Security:**  
  By chaining Cloudflare Worker and API Gateway with strict policies, I am able to minimize attack surface and prevent abuse.
- **Maintainability:**  
  Each component does one thing well and can be updated independently.
- **Scalability:**  
  Both bots can handle spikes in usage without any manual intervention.
- **Fun Factor:**  
  I got to play with both AWS and Cloudflare serverless stacks, and learned a ton about their quirks!

## **Conclusion**

Compared to the containerised ELT data pipeline (that I will write about soon...) I worked on previously, building these bots has been a refreshing dive into serverless architecture, automation, and security.

Happy automating!
