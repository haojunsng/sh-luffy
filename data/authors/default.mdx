I'm passionate about building things on the internet - because it means I can be productive without moving an inch.

My current work includes developing automation tools, building data pipelines, and creating user-friendly applications. I'm particularly interested in cloud architecture, DevOps practices, and emerging technologies.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me going on a run, a ride, and hopefully a swim soon...
