## Pirate's Manifest

I like building things that actually matter and solve problems.

I’m naturally curious and always excited to learn — there’s so much out there online that the world truly is your oyster, it’s hard not to.

Every project is a chance to discover new pearls of knowledge and build something useful.

## Previous Expeditions

- **2022 - 2024: ExpressVPN**

  Discovered my passion for building things on the internet.

- **2024: TikTok**

  Dived deep into data modelling to support analytics.

- **2024 - Present: GovTech**

  Working on public sector tech, building things that make a difference.

_More details in my resume!_
